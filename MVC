Layers in Spring:

User Interface -->  Controller, Service, Repository --> Database

-> User makes a request

-> Controller takes the request

-> Services is the place where your business logic is written. Controller based on the request delegates to particular service class.

-> Repository is nothing but DAO(Data Access Object) where the data base operations are written.

-> Based on the method it will make data base request
